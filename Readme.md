## What is Django?
Django is a Framework
# what is a Framework?
Framework has some patterns created and we will fill the gaps 
- Framework is the implementation of several tasks and give developers a structure for application development. Each framework comes with its own collection of modules or packages that significantly reduce development time._
 
# Framework vs Library

## **Backend**  
- API - send request and response
- Auth 
- session
- Database
- middlewares

## Python 

* Flask - easier to start [Library]
* Django - a big initial learning curve [Framework]
* Fast API - a bit more learning curve [Library]

## Tools 
* Pycharm 
* Postman
* python

## What is venv?
-



* **PYPI - Python Package Index**

### SETTINGS 
* helps to customize django application
* The setting has 
1. DEBUG = True which allows to run the application
2. DEBUG = False 
 - **CommandError:** You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.
 - When we set DEBUG = False and 
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost'] it will run the application and shows response as BAD REQUEST when we open the localhost:8000
    
* Django architecture works on the thought process of applications.
[ combination of apps ]
* sqlite3 is a file based database and stored in BASE_DIR/db.sqlite3
* We can change database at DATABASES variable in settings file.
* It supports all relational and some non-relational database.

# What is middleware?
- Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django’s request/response processing. It’s a light, low-level “plugin” system for globally altering Django’s input or output.

- Each middleware component is responsible for doing some specific function.

* **CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery**

* The **_makemigrations_** command looks at all your available models and creates migrations for whichever tables don’t already exist. 
* **_migrate_** runs the migrations and creates tables in your database, as well as optionally providing much richer schema control.

### python -m manage migrate 
- to change the schema
- creation of tables , adding primary key and columns

### python -m manage showmigrations


### python -m manage createsuperuser


#### View 
- It will tell what to respond for a request.

- URL pattern is like mapping routes to views.

1. Can we multiple views for a single request?
- No,
e.g; `path('', say_hello),
    path('', say_bye),`

2. Dunder init
3. 


#### Creating an application
* python -m manage startapp firstapp

* ##### **ORM - Object Relational Mapper**
